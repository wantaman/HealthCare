Patients with these infections are commonly seen by primary care providers, internists, emergency medicine specialists, hospitalists, and ophthalmologists. Each year in the United States alone, conjunctivitis accounts for more than 550,000 visits to emergency departments1 and many more visits to outpatient offices, keratitis is diagnosed at more than 1 million office and emergency department visits,2 exogenous endophthalmitis complicates up to 0.1% of the more than 7 million cataract surgeries and intravitreal injections performed,3-5 and thousands of patients are admitted to general hospitals to treat vision-threatening eye infections such as endogenous endophthalmitis and infectious uveitis.

It is typically acquired through contact with contaminated soil or fresh water. Before this investigation, B. pseudomallei was not known to have been isolated from the environment in the continental United States. Here, we report on three patients living in the same Mississippi Gulf Coast county who presented with melioidosis within a 3-year period. They were infected by the same Western Hemisphere B. pseudomallei strain that was discovered in three environmental samples collected from the property of one of the patients. These findings indicate local acquisition of melioidosis from the environment in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region.",
